        title: Avoid Use Of `goto` Statements
        body: |
          `goto` statements have a niche use and can obscure the normal flow of a program.
          Use of `goto` statements are discouraged as it becomes difficult to trace the
          control flow of a program.  
          
          ## Bad code
          ```golang
          // PrintValues prints each value up to and including the maximum value of 10
          func PrintValues() {
            i := 0
          Start:
            if i > 10 {
              goto End
            }
            fmt.Println(i)
            i++
            goto Start

          End:
            return
          }
          ```

            }
          }
          ```
